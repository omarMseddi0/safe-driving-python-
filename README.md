 code is designed to process a video frame by frame, detect persons in each frame using the YOLO model, and then classify each detected person using a separate classification model. The classification model determines whether the person is talking on a phone, holding a phone, or driving normally.
For the largest detected person in each frame, the code crops the image to that bounding box, resizes it, and saves it as a JPEG file. This cropped image is then passed to the classification model for prediction. The predicted class is mapped to a label, which is used to annotate the bounding box in the frame. The annotated frame is then displayed in a window. If no person is detected in a frame, the original frame is displayed.
